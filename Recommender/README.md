# CS-640-Project RECOMMENDER
Project for CS 640 -  Intro to AI - Fall 21 - Boston University

##For Recommending Classifications of Emotions:

For this exercise, We used the marginal probability of an emotion occuring related to a word as a way of recommending the final emotion for a new sentence encountered.

After analyzing the amount of work necessary to complete this task it was stopped after creating the indexes.
The information was valuable for data exploration. 

We found a research article that indicated it took 4 people 2 months to create a memory based reasoning solution and that would take too long for our project delivery date.
