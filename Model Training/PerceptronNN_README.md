# CS-640-Project Perceptron NN
Project for CS 640 -  Intro to AI - Fall 21 - Boston University

## Looking for simple models to separate the data.
We wrote a perceptron NN to look for the difference between two emotions. 

By creating a vectorized encoding of the words associated with one emotion and the words associated with another,
a two feature dataset was created to see if a clean line could be drawn between two emotions at a time.

The two continuums:
joy and sadness 
fear and anger 

The difficulty in separating the words along these two boundaries was difficult and by taking a sample of results did not produce a good separation in the data.

##  pla.py and pla2.py are the two Perceptron NN created for these experiments
